    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Old-fashioned English bread and butter pudding started out as a way to use up day-old bread, but now we make it just because it's glorious. Crisp-edged and soft in the middle, this is a cosy pudding you'll want to make on repeat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>25g/1oz butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>8 thick slices white bread, (crusts removed if desired)</li>
        <li>50g/2oz sultanas</li>
        <li>2 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>350ml/12fl oz full-fat milk</li>
        <li>50ml/2fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
        <li>25g/1oz granulated sugar</li>
        <li>nutmeg, grated, to taste</li>
        <li>custard, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease an ovenproof dish (about 23x28cm/9x11in) with butter.</li>
        <li>Butter each slice of bread on one side, then cut into triangles.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of bread, buttered-side up, in the bottom of the dish, then add a layer of sultanas. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then repeat the layers of bread and sultanas, sprinkling with cinnamon, until you have used up all of the bread. Finish with a layer of bread, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Gently warm the milk and cream in a saucepan over a low heat to scalding point. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add three-quarters of the sugar and lightly whisk until pale. Add the warm milk and cream mixture and stir well, then strain the custard into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard over the prepared bread layers, sprinkle with nutmeg and the remaining sugar and leave to stand for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30â€“40 minutes, or until the custard has set and the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve hot or warm with extra custard or cream.</li>
    </ol>
