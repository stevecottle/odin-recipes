        </ul>

        <ul>
            <h4><strong>To serve</strong></h4>
            <li>1 packet taco shells or soft taco wraps</li>
            <li>1 iceberg lettuce, chopped (any lettuce or salad leaves will work)</li>
            <li>150g/5½oz cheese, grated (use whatever hard cheese you have available)</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 avocado, peeled, stone removed, flesh smashed</li>
            <li>1 red chilli, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp freshly chopped coriander (or other soft herbs, such as parsley)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the mince base, heat the oil in a large frying pan or sauté pan over a medium heat, then add the onions, carrots, celery and peppers, stirring regularly until softened, this will take about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and stir until softened, then finally add the meat and brown all over (if you don’t have a very large pan you will need to remove the vegetable mixture and fry the mince in batches). Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>The mince base can be frozen at this stage: divide into batches and cool completely before freezing in bags or boxes.</li>
            <li>For the tacos, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the garlic and spices and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the mince base, along with a splash of water and cook on a low heat.</li>
            <li>If your mince base is frozen, defrost a little at room temperature or in the microwave (it doesn’t need to completely thawed before cooking, just soften enough to break up in the pan). Once defrosted, increase the heat and cook until the mince is piping hot.</li>
            <li>Serve with the taco shells, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, avocado, chilli and coriander.</li>
        </ol>
